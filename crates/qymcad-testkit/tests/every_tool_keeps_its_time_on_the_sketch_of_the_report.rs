//! EVERY TOOL OF A SKETCH KEEPS ITS TIME ON THE SKETCH OF THE REPORT: 973 lines and four patterns tied by 1 062 points on
//! lines into one part, 26 335 loops. Each tool through the door of the project the window calls, and after it the checks
//! the window counts again on a change (degrees of freedom, free points, conflicts, redundant) - each within its time.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: in that sketch every point of a line took some 20 s. The matrix of the tools on big sketches had no
//! sketch of one big part tied by points on lines, and the line was the only tool tried on it. The sketch has no corner
//! where two lines end at one point: the fillets and chamfers of corners, the offset and the extension find nothing to
//! work on in it and are timed idle.
