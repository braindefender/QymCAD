//! A POINT WHERE FOUR LINES MEET IS A CORNER OF TWO OF THEM.
//!
//! Reported: two squares drawn to share a single point could not be rounded or bevelled at that point at all - the
//! fillet and the chamfer asked for a corner "of exactly two lines" and found four, and said nothing at all. There is
//! a corner there, four of them: which one is meant is said by where the cursor stands, or by the two lines it was
//! named by. The point alone does not say, and refusing it outright is what made the tool look broken.
//!
//! And the other half of the same question: two lines lying along ONE straight line share a point and no angle, so
//! they make no corner either - the search for one goes on rather than stopping on a pair that has nothing to round.
