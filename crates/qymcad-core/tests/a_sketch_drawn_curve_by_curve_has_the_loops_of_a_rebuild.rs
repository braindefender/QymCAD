//! A SKETCH DRAWN CURVE BY CURVE HAS THE LOOPS OF A REBUILD: every kind of sketch, and a half disc of 48 segments closed
//! by its diameter, laid one curve at a time as a person draws them; after each curve the loops a rebuild of the change
//! makes (`regen_sketch`, the loops round what changed) are those of a rebuild from all the curves.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: the revolve of a half disc drawn segment by segment found no closed profile. The diameter drawn
//! last was laid in a window with only the two segments beside its ends, which hung there clear of the sides of the
//! window; the walk round them was left out, and the half disc with it.
