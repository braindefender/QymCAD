//! EVERY TOOL OF A SKETCH KEEPS ITS TIME ON A BIG SKETCH: each tool, through the door of the project the window calls,
//! on sketches of thousands of shapes - separate rectangles, a grid of two patterns, a pattern tied into one part, a
//! mixture - takes no more than a few rebuilds of that sketch. A tool that rebuilds the whole sketch for every element
//! it lays takes as many rebuilds as elements, and is caught however fast the machine.
//!
//! Reported behaviour (#95): a line and one across it, each patterned 200 times, and every operation waited 30 s - the
//! pattern rebuilt the sketch for each of its copies. The measure of the solve and the checks had not looked at the
//! tools that change a sketch.
