//! A field of the document that is missing from the file schema is lost silently.
//!
//! The format on disk is a separate type (`doc_file::DocumentFile`), and rightly so: the in-memory model is free
//! to change. The price is that the connection between them rests on attention alone — add a field to `Project`,
//! forget it in the schema, and the program builds, the tests stay green, and document properties are filled in
//! and lost on save without an error or a hint.
//!
//! That is exactly what happened to the document properties (author, title, version, comment): they were absent
//! from the schema entirely, while the tests nearby checked the creation date and whether anything leaked into
//! the settings — but not the file. This guard closes the whole class: every field of the model is either in the
//! schema or named here with a reason.

/// The field names of a struct, read from the source. A crude parse, but exact for the declaration style used
/// here.
