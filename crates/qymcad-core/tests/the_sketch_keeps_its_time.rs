//! A SKETCH KEEPS ITS TIME: the budgets of issue #95 on sketches of separate shapes (`sketch_kinds`), timed through the
//! project's own doors. The measure of every kind and size is `sketch_speed.rs`; these are the budgets that hold.
//!
//! THE PROBES OF TIME RUN AT THE `time` LEVEL ALONE (`QYMCAD_TIER=time`, `tools/gate.py time`), one at a time: they
//! measure the machine as much as the program, and beside the other checks of a crate they read the load. At any other
//! level each passes over. A budget in milliseconds is scaled by `QYMCAD_TIME_SCALE`, as the probes of time of the
//! acceptance set are. Measured: a budget of 150 ms read 165 ms on a runner of the CI among the checks of every crate.
