//! THE REDUNDANT CONSTRAINTS OF A BIG PART ARE FOUND IN TIME: a ladder of 500 rungs, each held by its ends on two rails,
//! is one part of 1 000 points on lines; one of them laid twice is the one redundancy. The count names the two and
//! nothing else, in a fraction of a second.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: a sketch of 973 lines tied by 1 062 points on lines took some 20 s for every point of a line
//! drawn in it. On every change the redundant constraints were counted by taking each constraint of the part out in
//! turn and counting the part again: 9 s a count.
