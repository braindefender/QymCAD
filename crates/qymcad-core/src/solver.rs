    // It must not, however, compete with the constraints. At weight 1e-3 the solution settled into an
    // equilibrium between a dimension and the pull towards the old position, with an error of roughly
    // 1e-6 · displacement — enough to yield −129.99900 instead of −130. Hence the two stages: weight 1e-3
    // first, which steers towards the nearest solution, then a polish at 1e-9, which keeps the tie-breaker
    // while pushing the distortion of dimensions below machine precision.
    //
    // The mouse weight sits below the weight of the constraints, not above it. At 5.0 the cursor outranked any
    // dimension fivefold, and a fully constrained 40×25 rectangle stretched some fifty millimetres after the
    // mouse before snapping back on release. The dimensions themselves were fine; what lied was the display,
    // and the reading was that the dimensions do not hold. Fully constrained geometry must not move at all
    // under a drag — the reasoning is written up at `solve_sketch_drag`.
    //
    // Why a small weight suffices instead of projecting onto the null space: along the free directions the
    // constraints have no gradient, so nothing competes with the mouse and the point reaches the cursor at any
    // weight. Along the constrained directions the equilibrium distorts a constraint by w²/(1+w²) of the
    // displacement — 96 % at weight 5.0, which is what was observed, and 0.04 % at 0.02, below line thickness
    // for any reasonable drag.
    //
    // The weight is bounded from below twice: by the `w_reg` tie-breaker (1e-3), which the mouse has to
    // outweigh or the point sticks to its old position, and by the conditioning of the system, see the
    // measurements below.
    //
    // The value comes from a measured curve rather than from picking something small. At 0.02 the quality is
    // excellent — a constrained sketch does not budge — but the performance guard showed the drag frame on a
    // large sketch rising to 191 ms from 97: too small a weight conditions the system poorly and LM burns the
    // whole iteration budget. Point by point:
    //
    //     weight   drag frame   drift of a constrained sketch
