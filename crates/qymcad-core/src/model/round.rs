//! THE LOOPS ROUND A CHANGE. When curves of a sketch move, only the regions they bounded or crossed before and the
//! regions they bound or cross now can change; every other region stands. They used to be found as every curve whose
//! box meets a moved one, and every curve whose box meets one of those, and so on - in a grid where every line crosses
//! every line across it that is the whole sketch: a frame of a drag of one line of a grid of 200 by 200 made all its
//! 40 000 cells again, 0.7 s in a release build.
//!
//! Here the regions are made inside a window: the boxes of the moved curves where they stood and where they stand (the
//! swept boxes), and of the regions that held them before. Every curve that meets the window is laid, and four lines
//! are laid round it. A region inside the window and clear of those four lines is a region of the whole sketch: a
//! curve that would cut it meets its box, and so the window, and is laid. A region that meets a swept box and runs
//! into the side of the window may go on past it, and the window grows on that side to the farthest curve laid; a side
//! already past every curve of the sketch has nothing behind it, and what runs into it is the outside.
//!
//! The open chains are made apart, from the curves joined end to end with a moved one: a chain is all the curves so
//! joined, wherever they reach.
