//! THE PREVIEW OF A CORNER IS THE CORNER THAT WILL BE MADE.
//!
//! Reported: with the fillet of a corner, while the radius was being typed, the arc was drawn "always in the direction
//! away from the horizontal line", and the fillet that came on Enter landed in the corner all the same. The two ends of
//! the preview were the right ones - they are the points the lines are cut at, and they are cut there - but the arc
//! between them was walked the other way round.
//!
//! WHY. The angles of the arc were taken from the drawing's own coordinates and the points were then plotted on the
//! screen. The sheet turns the drawing over (`Sheet::at` takes the sign of y off), so an angle read before the turn is
//! walked backwards after it: the arc came out mirrored about the horizontal, and mirroring it is not the same arc.
//! The chamfer showed nothing of this, because a straight cut between two points does not care which way round it is
//! walked.
//!
//! So what is checked here is the ARC, and by the property that tells the two apart without arithmetic of its own: a
//! fillet takes the corner off, so its arc bulges towards the corner - nearer the vertex than the straight chord
//! between its ends. Mirrored, the same arc bulges the other way and is further from the vertex than the chord.
