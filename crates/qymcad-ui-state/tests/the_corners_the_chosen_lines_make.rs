//! THE CORNERS THE CHOSEN LINES MAKE, AND WHAT A CLICK AT A POINT DOES TO THEM.
//!
//! The fillet and the chamfer are cut off corners, and a corner is not a thing a person points at: it is where two
//! chosen lines meet. So the set of corners is not written down by a person picking corners one after another — it
//! follows from the lines that are chosen, and every rule here is about what follows from what.
//!
//! **THE LINES WAITING AT A POINT ARE PAIRED TWO AT A TIME, IN THE ORDER THEY WERE CHOSEN.** Four lines through one
//! point give two corners: the first with the second, the third with the fourth.
//!
//! **A CORNER IS REMEMBERED, NOT READ OFF THE SELECTION EVERY TIME.** Letting a line go takes its corner with it,
//! and the line that stays does not pair again with a neighbour of the one that left — so of A, B, C, D chosen
//! across one point, letting B go leaves C D standing and A waiting, and letting C go as well leaves A D as the
//! corner. Reading the pairs off the selection afresh made A C instead, which nobody had asked for.
//!
//! **A CLICK AT A POINT IS ABOUT THAT POINT ALONE**: the chosen lines do not move. A corner named there is taken
//! away, a corner of the lines standing there is put away (and comes back on the same click), and a point where
//! nothing stands takes the corner the cursor read.
