//! ANY LEFT CLICK WITHOUT SHIFT IS A SINGLE SELECTION — WHATEVER IT LANDED ON.
//!
//! The fillet and the chamfer cut a set of corners, and the set is what the chosen lines make. More than one line is
//! chosen with Shift held, and a multi-selection that outlives the key is a mode a person cannot see and cannot get
//! out of: reported, a click that was meant for one corner cut the whole set instead. So every left click without
//! Shift leaves the multi-selection behind — a line, a point, or nothing at all — and what it then chooses is a
//! matter of what it landed on, and only that.
//!
//! **THE LINES CHOSEN STAY CHOSEN WHERE THE CLICK MEANT NOTHING.** A click on empty space says which mode the tool
//! is in; it is not a command to forget the drawing.
//!
//! **A CLICK ON A POINT WITHOUT SHIFT IS A SINGLE SELECTION OF A POINT, LIKE A CLICK ON A LINE IS OF A LINE.** It was
//! the one exception, and the exception is what made the tool read as two tools. A point already in the set clicked
//! again without Shift is the one thing to let go of, and the whole set goes with it.
//!
//! **THE CLICK THAT OPENS THE FIELD GROWS THE SET RATHER THAN SINGLING IT OUT**: the field is closed when the tool
//! is taken, so there is no set in hand to single out, and the lines standing chosen are the beginning of one.
