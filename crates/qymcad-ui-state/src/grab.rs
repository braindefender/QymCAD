//! THE GRAB RADIUS FOLLOWS THE ROLE OF THE TARGET, NOT THE PLACE IN THE CODE.
//!
//! There were 42 hard-wired thresholds in `pick.rs` and `sketching.rs`, and they differed for two reasons
//! that have to be told apart.
//!
//! **Between roles the difference is LEGITIMATE.** Aiming at a point is harder than aiming at a line:
//! a point occupies a pixel, a line stretches across half the screen. Giving them one radius would
//! either make points uncatchable or make lines steal clicks from their neighbours. Mature CAD systems
//! work the same way.
//!
//! **Within a role the difference is PURE ARBITRARINESS.** The same vertex was caught from 8, 9, 10,
//! 13 and 18 pixels in six different functions; an edge from 7, 8 and 10 in seven. A user cannot
//! explain that, because there is no explanation: the numbers were typed in place and from memory.
//!
//! So there are ROLES here rather than one number. A role names WHAT is being caught, and how many
//! pixels that is comes from one table and one precision multiplier.

/// What exactly the cursor catches. The grab radius depends on the role.
