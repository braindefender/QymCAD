//! THE NUMBERS OF THE POINTS WAIT FOR THEIR SETTING: a sketch shows its shapes alone, with no number beside a point; the
//! box "Numbers of the points" in Settings -> Sketch, ticked by hand, brings the numbers, and unticked takes them away.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: every point of a sketch carried its number - for a person drawing they meant nothing and cluttered
//! the sheet; they were there for looking into a sketch.
