//! A PATTERN ACROSS A PATTERN IS LAID BY HAND, through the window: a line and another across it, each patterned by the
//! linear pattern tool - the count and the steps typed in its bar, Enter - make a grid of cells, and the frames over it
//! stay quick.
//!
//! Reported behaviour (#95): one line horizontal and one vertical, each patterned 200 times 20 mm apart, and every
//! operation of the sketch waited 30 s or more. Each copy of a pattern rebuilt the loops of the whole growing grid.
