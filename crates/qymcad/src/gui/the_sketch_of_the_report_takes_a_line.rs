//! THE SKETCH OF THE REPORT TAKES A LINE: the document of the report opened through File, the part and then its sketch
//! entered by a double click in the tree, the Line tool taken and two points clicked - each step in the time of a few
//! frames. The sketch: 973 lines and four patterns tied by 1 062 points on lines into one part, 26 335 loops.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: in that sketch every point of a line took some 20 s, and nothing could be drawn. Each change
//! counted the redundant constraints one by one over the whole part (9 s), and each frame with the sketch selected in
//! the 3D view looked for every loop along the list of the sketch's loops (4.3 s).
