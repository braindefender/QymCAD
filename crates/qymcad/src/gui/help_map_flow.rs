//! THE TOOL-TO-ARTICLE LINK AND F1 BY CONTEXT.
//!
//! The help rots silently: a tool is renamed, split in two, removed — and the article stays and goes
//! on lying with confidence. The only cure is a link the build checks.
//!
//! There are three guards here, different in meaning:
//! 1. **every tool of the panels is in the table** — otherwise F1 will not answer;
//! 2. **every row of the table points at a tool that exists** — otherwise it is an article about
//!    something the program does not have;
//! 3. **THE RATCHET**: how many promised articles are still unwritten. It is lowered step by step down
//!    to zero. Demanding all the articles at once would keep the build red for weeks — that is,
//!    switch the guard off; the same device is already at work on the counter of untranslated
//!    lines.
