//! A SKETCH SAYS WHAT IT DID NOT SOLVE IN TIME, through the window: the panel of a sketch whose last solve ran out of
//! time names the groups of shapes left, and an edit by hand - a point dragged - solves them and the line goes.
//!
//! The state is laid through the project's own door (`Project::solve_sketch_within` with no time): a sketch big enough
//! to run a solve out of its 10 s is not a check that runs in seconds.
