//! COPYING PUTS THE DRAWING TOOL DOWN FIRST.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: copying while a tool is active does not cancel the tool, and the result is a defect.
//!
//! Copying is a command over what is SELECTED, while a tool is busy with what is being BUILT. Leaving both
//! armed puts two consumers on the next click: the copy waits for a base point, the tool waits for the next
//! vertex. Whichever gets there first, the person did not ask for it — and a half-built shape stays behind on
//! the canvas with nothing to finish it.
