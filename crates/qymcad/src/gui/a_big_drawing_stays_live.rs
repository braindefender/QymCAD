//! A BIG DRAWING STAYS LIVE, through the window: a DXF of thousands of segments, written by the check itself, comes in
//! through "Import", is laid on a plane, and the sketch it makes is worked by hand - the pointer over it, a corner
//! dragged - each frame timed.
//!
//! Reported behaviour (#95): a sketch of a few hundred lines hangs the program.
