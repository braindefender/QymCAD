//! A DIMENSION FROM A CIRCLE TO A COORDINATE AXIS.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: "I placed a circle, I am trying to put a dimension from its centre to the X or Y
//! axis, and the axis WILL NOT be picked - a crooked dimension is placed instead."
//!
//! The distance from a hole to an edge or to a datum is the commonest dimension there is in a drawing.
//! Placed against the wrong reference it does not merely look wrong: the value is measured to something
//! else, and the part comes out of the machine to that other number.
//!
//! WHAT IT TURNED OUT TO BE. Measured on the reporter's own file: the sketch ORIGIN had moved.
//!
//! ```text
//! points:  id: 4, x: -23.454944474040893, y: 18.70469405576201   <- the origin
//!          id: 10, x: 1.0, y: 0.0                                 <- the X axis guide
//! origin: 4,  axis_pts: (10, 11)
//! DistancePL(p: 7, a: 4, b: 10, d: 55.27876336781576)
//! ```
//!
//! An axis is the infinite line through the origin and its guide point. With the origin at
//! (-23.45, 18.70) the "X axis" is a DIAGONAL, and a distance to it is honestly measured - to the wrong
//! line. Both numbers on the screen, 55.3 and 55.0, are exactly that.
//!
//! HOW IT MOVED. `sketch_hit` leaves the origin pickable on purpose, so that a point can be made
//! coincident with it - and a pickable point is a draggable one. `Constraint::Fixed` pins a point to
//! where it IS, not to zero, so one drag locks the reference frame at its new place for good.
//!
//! The origin and the axis guides are the frame of reference, not geometry. They do not move.
