//! THE CHAIN BEING DRAWN MARKS ITS OWN CORNERS, through the window: while a chain of lines is drawn, the dots the
//! preview puts at its corners stand on the corners as they are - after an automatic constraint has moved them - and
//! not where the clicks were.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: drawing lines, a second dot stood beside every corner a few pixels off it, and went only with Esc;
//! a Perpendicular laid by auto-constraints had moved the corner, and the tool kept the place of the click.
