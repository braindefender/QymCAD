//! AN AUTOMATIC PARALLEL STAYS IN ITS SHAPE, through the window with auto-constraints on: two triangles drawn one after
//! the other with Line share no constraint, however alike their sides; a parallelogram drawn with Line gets a Parallel
//! on each pair of its opposite sides.
//!
//! Reported behaviour (#94): a second triangle drawn beside the first got a Parallel to a side of it - any line of the
//! sketch within about 3.4 deg of the new one was taken, wherever it stood - and an edit of one moved the other.
