//! AN ARC DRAWN BY ITS CENTRE ENDS ON ITSELF, through the window: the third click gives the direction the arc runs to,
//! and its end point lands on the circle of the start's radius in that direction, wherever the click was.
//!
//! Reported behaviour (#62): the arc was drawn with the radius of the start, and its end point stayed where the third
//! click was - inside or outside the arc, away from its end.
