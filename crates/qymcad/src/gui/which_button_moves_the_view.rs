//! WHICH BUTTON MOVES THE VIEW IS THE PERSON'S CHOICE.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: "add a way to choose how the mouse behaves in the settings: ours, or as in other
//! CADs, where the way it works in the 3D viewport and in sketches is picked from a list."
//!
//! It was written into the viewport: a drag turned the model, full stop. That is quick, and its price is
//! that a drag begun on the model is never a selection - which is exactly what somebody arriving from a
//! CAD where the left button only ever selects trips over on the first minute.
//!
//! A SET, NOT THREE SWITCHES. The combinations that are not sets are nonsense: "the left button turns the
//! view AND draws a selection box" is not a preference, it is a conflict. So the choice is one named set,
//! and the full list lives next to the type - a list written out in the settings window would fall behind
//! on the first set added.
//!
//! ONE ANSWER FOR THE TURN AND THE MOVE. They are the same gesture with a modifier; asking which button
//! navigates twice is how the two would come to disagree, and a view that turns with one button and moves
//! with another is a bug nobody can describe.
