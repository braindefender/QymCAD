//! A SIDE OF A RECTANGLE DELETED LEAVES THE OTHER LINES HELD, through the window: the top side picked and Delete
//! pressed, the three lines left are held Horizontal and Vertical, the two uprights Equal, with nothing over-defined -
//! as plain lines a person drew would be, and as a rectangle of lines keeps them in other systems.
//!
//! Reported behaviour (#72): the lines left were plain, held by nothing, though they still stood level and square.
