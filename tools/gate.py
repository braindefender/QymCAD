"""THE GATE: a level of the run of the checks, run and reported.

    tools/gate.py fast      at every edit, minutes: the rules of the code, the checks of the oracles themselves, and the
                            acceptance probes that do no heavy geometry
    tools/gate.py full      before a commit: the fast level, plus every other crate - the kernel, the heavy geometry,
                            the matrices of the testkit - and every acceptance probe, the short generated chains with them
    tools/gate.py release   before the public repository: the full level with the long generated chains, and every
                            breakage on order (`tools/breakages.py`) caught. A whole run of it leaves its mark in
                            `target/gate-release.json` - the commit, whether the tree was clean, whether it passed - and
                            `tools/publish.py` refuses without that mark for the commit it publishes
    tools/gate.py L --step NAME     only the step of the level whose name begins with NAME (and no mark)
    tools/gate.py L --except NAME   every step of the level but that one (and no mark)
    tools/gate.py L --shard K/N     the acceptance probes of the level split in N shares, only the K-th run (and no mark)
    tools/gate.py L --skip-probe P  the acceptance probes matching P left out (and no mark)
    tools/gate.py time              the probes of time alone, one at a time; CI sets QYMCAD_TIME_SCALE=2

EVERY RED STOPS THE GATE: a red probe is a trouble to mend before the commit, not a row to keep beside it.

`full` leaves `target/gate-full.json` with the tree it ran on, and `tools/hooks/pre-commit` lets a commit through only
when that tree is the one being committed and the level passed (switched on by `git config core.hooksPath tools/hooks`).

Each step runs under a memory cap without swap - the acceptance set is a process a probe, six at a time. The report
names what passed, what is red, and how long each step took.
